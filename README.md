AQ War Data Gatherer WoW Classic addon repo


AQ War Data Gatherer is a very simple add-on for WoW Classic, that gathers AQ War effort progress data from the city NPCs, and present it in a machine processable format (CSV etc.).

This is my first WoW add-on, and my first interaction with Lua. I know it can be done in a much better way, but I just needed it do what it does.
